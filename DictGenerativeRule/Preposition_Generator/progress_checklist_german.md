# Progress Checklist - German Content Generation

Generate German content for prepositions following rules in CLAUDE_Preposition_ENG_GER.md

## Instructions
- Mark tasks with [x] BEFORE starting work on a batch
- Only work on ONE batch at a time
- Create a new file named `[original_filename]_german.json` in the same folder
- Each German file should contain only: lemma, meanings_de, definitions_de, examples_de

## Tasks

- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_1_to_10.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_11_to_20.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_21_to_30.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_31_to_40.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_41_to_50.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_51_to_60.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_61_to_70.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_71_to_80.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_81_to_90.jsonl
- [x] Prepositions_Json/prepositions_91_to_94.jsonl

## Notes
- Each JSONL file contains completed preposition entries with English content
- German content should feel natural to native speakers, NOT direct translations
- Files use JSONL format (one object per line)
- Remember to bold German prepositions in examples using **bold** formatting
- Pay special attention to:
  - Case governance (Akkusativ/Dativ)
  - Contracted forms (am, im, zum, zur)
  - Different preposition mappings (at â†’ an/bei/um/zu)
- Mark [x] when you BEGIN working on a file
- Create _german.json files in the same directory as source files
