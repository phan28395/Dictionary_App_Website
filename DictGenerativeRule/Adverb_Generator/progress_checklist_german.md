# Progress Checklist - German Content Generation

Generate German content for adverbs following rules in CLAUDE_Adverb_ENG_GER.md

## Instructions
- Mark tasks with [x] BEFORE starting work on a batch
- Only work on ONE batch at a time
- Create a new file named `[original_filename]_german.json` in the same folder
- Each German file should contain only: lemma, meanings_de, definitions_de, examples_de

## Tasks

- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_1_to_50/lemmas_1_to_50.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_51_to_100/lemmas_51_to_100.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_101_to_150/lemmas_101_to_150.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_151_to_200/lemmas_151_to_200.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_201_to_250/lemmas_201_to_250.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_251_to_300/lemmas_251_to_300.jsonl
- [x] Adverbs_Json/lemmas_301_to_331/lemmas_301_to_331.jsonl

## Notes
- Each JSONL file contains completed adverb entries with English content
- German content should feel natural to native speakers, NOT direct translations
- Files use JSONL format (one object per line)
- Remember to bold German adverbs in examples using **bold** formatting
- Consider German adverb position rules and modal particles
- Mark [x] when you BEGIN working on a file
- Create _german.json files in the same directory as source files
