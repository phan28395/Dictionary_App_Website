- Supabase only for authentication and license status
- Complete offline functionality after initial auth
- No cloud tracking of searches or usage

### Supabase Integration Points
Only 3 minimal tables needed in Supabase:
1. `user_profiles` - License status only
2. `purchases` - Payment records
3. `device_activations` - Device limits

### Next Session Should Start With
1. **Create Licensing Plugin** (`plugins/licensing/`)
   - Integrate with existing search count from history
   - Check premium status from auth plugin
   - Implement 50-search limit enforcement
   - Add upgrade flow with Stripe

2. **Test with Actual Supabase**:

   - Add tables from CLAUDE.md
   - Test login/register flow

3. **Build System** (alternative):
   - PyInstaller configuration
   - Create distributable package
   - Test on fresh system

### Architecture Decisions
- Supabase used minimally (auth only, no data sync)
- Guest mode works completely offline
- Search tracking stays local for privacy
- Auth plugin exposes API for other plugins via `app.auth`

### Technical Notes
- Fixed storage path initialization issue in plugin
- Auth plugin loads after core plugins
- Guest data stored in `data/plugin-storage/auth/`
- Supabase client optional (falls back to guest mode)

The authentication system is ready! Next step is licensing to monetize the app.

- [x] Phase 2.1: SQLCipher encryption support (fallback to SQLite)
- [x] Phase 2.3: Search engine core with inflection lookup
- [x] Phase 2.4: Plugin system foundation with lifecycle management
- [x] Phase 2.5: Event system with priorities and wildcard support
- [x] Phase 2.6: Plugin API exposed through app object
- [x] Main application class tying everything together
- [x] Sample data import and search testing

### Files Created/Modified (Session 2)
- `core/database.py` - Database layer with connection pooling and encryption
- `core/search.py` - Search engine with inflection lookup and caching
- `core/plugin.py` - Plugin loader and base Plugin class
- `core/events.py` - Event emitter system with priorities
- `core/app.py` - Main application class coordinating all components
- `core/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `test_core.py` - Test script verifying core functionality
- `import_sample.py` - Sample data import script
- `data/sample_data.jsonl` - Test data with 5 entries

### Current State
**Core Engine Complete**: All headless components are working!
- Database layer operational with SQLite (SQLCipher ready but not required)
- Search engine finds words and handles inflections
- Plugin system loads and manages plugins
- Event system enables plugin communication
- Main app coordinates everything with clean API

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Database connects and initializes
- ✅ Search works for direct lemmas
- ✅ Inflection lookup functioning (went → go)
- ✅ Autocomplete suggestions working
- ✅ Event system operational
- ✅ Configuration system with env overrides

### Next Session Should Start With
1. **Phase 3.1**: Create default UI plugin (`plugins/core-ui/`)
2. Start with plugin manifest.json
3. Implement basic system tray integration
4. Add global hotkey listener for Ctrl+Ctrl

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Used regular SQLite instead of SQLCipher for development (encryption optional)
- Views for POS-specific data instead of separate tables
- Simple in-memory cache for search results
- No sandboxing for plugins (Obsidian model)
- Plugin storage in data/plugin-storage/{plugin-id}/

### Open Questions/Blockers
- POS-specific view queries need adjustment (using entry_id vs id)
- Consider adding frequency_rank column to schema
- SQLCipher requires system libraries (optional for now)

## Session Summary - 2025-08-28 (Implementation Started)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 1.1: Created main project directory structure
- [x] Phase 1.2: Set up Python virtual environment
- [x] Phase 1.2: Created requirements.txt with core dependencies (pysqlcipher3, watchdog, python-dotenv, keyring, orjson)
- [x] Phase 1.2: Created requirements-dev.txt for development tools
- [x] Phase 1.3: Created .env.example with all configuration options
- [x] Phase 1.3: Created default_config.json with complete default settings
- [x] Phase 1.3: Implemented configuration loader (core/config.py) with priority-based loading

### Files Created/Modified
- `dictionary_app/` - Main project directory with all subdirectories
- `dictionary_app/requirements.txt` - Core dependencies only (no UI libraries)
- `dictionary_app/requirements-dev.txt` - Development tools (pytest, black, mypy, etc.)
- `dictionary_app/.env.example` - Complete configuration template
- `dictionary_app/config/default_config.json` - Default configuration with all settings
- `dictionary_app/core/config.py` - Configuration management system with env override support
- `dictionary_app/data/database_schema.sql` - Copied database schema
- `dictionary_app/import_dictionary_data.py` - Copied data import script
- `dictionary_app/data/inflection_lookup.tsv` - Copied inflection lookup data

### Current State
**Foundation Ready**: Project structure is complete, configuration system is working.
The configuration loader supports:
- Multiple configuration sources (env vars, .env, config.json, defaults)
- Priority-based loading (env vars override everything)
- Dot notation for nested values
- Type conversion for booleans and numbers
- Path resolution for file paths

### Next Session Should Start With
1. **Phase 2.1**: Implement database layer with SQLite/SQLCipher
2. Create database connection manager with pooling
3. Add encryption layer using hardware-based key derivation
4. Test database initialization and schema creation

### Decisions Made
- Used pysqlcipher3 for database encryption (compatible with SQLCipher)
- Configuration system follows Obsidian model (simple JSON + env overrides)
- Kept requirements minimal - UI libraries will go in UI plugin
- Directory structure matches plan exactly

### Open Questions/Blockers
- pysqlcipher3 installation may require system SQLCipher libraries
- Need to verify hardware ID generation works cross-platform
- Consider fallback if keyring is not available on system

## Session Summary - 2025-08-28 (Planning Phase)

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed plugin-based architecture requirements vs user experience flow
- [x] Identified contradictions between hardcoded UI and plugin flexibility
- [x] Updated user_experience_flow.md with Obsidian-style extension marketplace
- [x] Analyzed actual JSON structure in DictGenerativeRule_2/ for all POS types
- [x] Created comprehensive database_schema.sql based on real data structure
- [x] Built import_dictionary_data.py to handle all POS-specific fields
- [x] Created complete implementation plan in CLAUDE.md with 663 lines of guidance

### Files Created/Modified
- `user_experience_flow.md` - Added Extensions tab, Extension Store, Developer Mode sections
- `database_schema.sql` - Complete schema with POS-specific tables and optimizations
- `import_dictionary_data.py` - Data import script handling all POS types with their unique fields
- `CLAUDE.md` - Master implementation plan with 10 phases and detailed checkboxes

### Current State
**Planning Complete**: All foundation work is done. Ready for development to begin.

**Key Architecture Decided**:
- Core engine is headless (NO UI code in core)
- Everything is a plugin (even default UI is replaceable)
- Simple plugin system like Obsidian (no sandboxing)
- Database structure matches actual JSON data perfectly
- Extension marketplace integrated into user experience

**Database Schema Ready**: 
- Supports all 4 POS types with their specific fields
- Optimized with proper indexes and views
- Handles inflection lookup (went → go)
- User management and licensing ready

### Next Session Should Start With
1. **Begin Phase 1.1**: Create main project directory structure
2. **Set up Python environment** with requirements.txt (core dependencies only)
3. **Examine** the database_schema.sql to understand the structure
4. **Run** import_dictionary_data.py to populate database with real data

### Decisions Made
- **Plugin Architecture**: Like Obsidian - simple, no sandboxing, full access
- **Database**: SQLCipher encryption, JSON fields for arrays, POS-specific tables
- **UI Strategy**: Default flow in user_experience_flow.md becomes core-ui plugin
- **Extension Model**: Free + paid ($0.99-$4.99), 30% commission, GitHub registry
- **Security**: Keep simple, hardware-based licensing, community trust model

### Open Questions/Blockers
- None. All major architectural decisions made. Ready for implementation.

### Key Implementation Reminders
1. **Core = Headless**: Never put UI code in core/ directory
2. **Everything = Plugin**: Even settings, auth, licensing are plugins
3. **Simple Plugin System**: Just drop folder in plugins/ and it works
4. **Database First**: Use the schema exactly as designed for POS fields
5. **Get It Working**: Focus on correctness, optimize performance later
