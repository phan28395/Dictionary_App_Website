# Dictionary App Website - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a clean, professional marketing website for the Dictionary App product. This website will serve as the main download portal, account management system, and community hub. The Dictionary App itself already exists - we are ONLY building the website to promote and distribute it.

**IMPORTANT**: This document is for website creation only. The Dictionary App is already built and functional.

## Primary Goals
1. **Showcase the product** with professional screenshots and features
2. **Provide download links** for all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
3. **Handle account management** (login, license activation, purchase history)
4. **Display pricing** clearly with comparison table
5. **Build community** with links to forums and support
6. **Easy content updates** through markdown/JSON files

## Technology Stack Recommendation
- **Option 1 (Simple)**: Static HTML/CSS/JS + GitHub Pages
- **Option 2 (Modern)**: Next.js + Vercel (better for dynamic content)
- **Option 3 (Middle)**: Astro (static site generator with good performance)
